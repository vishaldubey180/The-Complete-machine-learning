Once we have these books we read each and every page of those book and try to find out different pieces of information which are important , which are the pattern , let's say we have science exams so we will try to pick out some important concepts from it . the question which are more likely to come in exams like oxidation, reduction, periodic table. to answer particular question we need to have visited that concept\n",
